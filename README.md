PRODIGY_CS_04 — Simple Keylogger (Educational Purpose Only)

This project is developed as part of my Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security Internship (Task 04).

This is a safe, ethical, and limited-scope keylogger that logs ONLY the keys typed inside its own Tkinter window.
It does NOT record system-wide keystrokes and is purely for educational learning.

🔍 How It Works

Opens a Tkinter window

User types inside the input box

Every keystroke is logged with:

Timestamp

Key pressed (character or special key)

Logs are displayed on-screen and saved to key_log.txt

🛑 Important (Ethical Use Only)

This tool cannot capture system-wide keys.
It is designed strictly for learning:

✔ How keylogging works internally
✔ How to capture events in GUI applications
✔ Safe cybersecurity experimentation

▶️ How to Run the Program
python keylogger_tool.py


Then:

Type inside the text box

Every key will appear in the log window

Log file will be saved as key_log.txt

Press Clear Display to reset on-screen logs (file remains)

🧠 Example Log Entry
